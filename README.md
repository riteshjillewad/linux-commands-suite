# 🐧 Linux Command Suite
The Linux Command Suite is a **collection of custom implementations of fundamental Linux utilities written in C**. Instead of relying on existing GNU utilities, we developed our own versions of important commands to understand their internal working at the OS level. Each command is uniquely identified with the postfix letter _"my"_(ex `myls`, `mypwd`, `mycp`). **This project demonstrates deep understanding of Linux internals, system calls, file systems, and process management.**

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:
* Re-implement commonly used Linux commands
* Use system calls wherever required
* Understand file descriptors, processes, directories, and permissions
* Strengthen low-level C programming skills
* Learn how real UNIX utilities are built
